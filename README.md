# richardscarrott.co.uk [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/richardscarrott/richardscarrott.co.uk.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/richardscarrott/richardscarrott.co.uk)

`CLIENT_ENV=production npm run build &&
npm run serve`

Built with: https://github.com/60frames/react-boilerplate/

## TODO
- Now env vars are handled at release time rather than build time feature switching
is only surface level so would make sense to include concept for feature switching using DefinePlugin.
